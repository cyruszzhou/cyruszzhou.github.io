        - title: Analyzing and exposing retry bugs in large-scale distributed systems.
          contents:
            - Current ongoing project.
            - Developed Tempura (Testing Engine for Monitoring and Proving Uncovered Retry Areas), a tool that validates and tracks the retry behavior within large-scale distributed systems (currently supporting Java and C#) by code injection.
            - Developed Coconut (Code Coverage for iNdividual Unit Tests), a tool that leverages JaCoCo to find the line coverage of each individual unit test, which is intended to be used for finding out useful unit tests to simulate and eventually expose retry bugs in large-scale distributed systems (e.g., hadoop).
        - title: Detecting and Exposing Idempotency Violations in Serverless Computing.
          contents:
            - This project aimed to clarify the retry mechanisms of major serverless providers and present the first analysis of idempotency violations in serverless applications. Specifically, this study exposed the pervasiveness and severity of the problem as well as illustrated the root causes, symptoms, and fixes. It generalized idempotency violation patterns from statically checkable instances in bug study and used these patterns to find more cases.
            - Collected 100+ Problematic Codebases from Open Source Github Repositories, categorized them by application type, API type, root cause, and symptoms, found general anti-patterns that lead to idempotency violations. 
            - Deployed 20+ repositories of serverless softwares, tested static checkers for anti-patterns and testing framework for symptom diagnosis.
        - title: User-centric Development and Debugging of Trigger-Action Programs.
          contents:
            - This project aimed to research the first empirical study of users' end-to-end TAP debugging process, focusing on obstacles users face in debugging TAPs and how well users ultimately fix incorrect automation. The final paper was accepted (with minor or no modification) by UbiComp/IMWUT.
            - Designed user study methodology, proposed, and refined the user obstacles mental model.
            - Tested and refined the software system.
            - Conducted user study, analyzed the result, and composed the paper.

        - title: Architectural Support for Mixed Precision Neural Networks.
          contents:
          - Current ongoing project, leading.
          - Added Heterogenous SIMD support (with precision information stored in the metadata register) to the GEM5 simulator.
          - Replicated existing mixed-precision schemes on SIMD architecture.
          - Led and coordinated a team of 5 students.
        - title: Data Scheduling for Neural Networks on CPUs using SIMD Architecture.
          contents:
          - We address the challenges associated with deploying neural networks on CPUs, with a particular focus on minimizing inference time while maintaining accuracy. Our novel approach is to use the dataflow (i.e., computation order) of a neural network to explore data reuse opportunitie using heuristic-guided analysis and a code generation framework, which enables exploration of various Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) implementations to achieve optimized neural network execution. Our results demonstrate that the dataflow that keeps outputs in SIMD registers while also maximizing both input and weight reuse consistently yields the best performance for a wide variety of inference workloads, achieving up to 2.7x speedup for 8-bit neural networks, and up to 4.8x speed up for binary neural networks, respectively, over the state-of-the-art SIMD implementations of neural networks today.
          - Proposed the research idea, extended discussion on neural network dataflows, developed a code generation framework, set up ARM server and, on top of it, the Gem5 simulator, ran experiments, analyzed results, composed the paper.
