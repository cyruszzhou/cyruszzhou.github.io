            - Current ongoing project.
        - title: Detecting and Exposing Idempotency Violations in Serverless Computing.
          contents:
            - This project aimed to clarify the retry mechanisms of major serverless providers and present the first analysis of idempotency violations in serverless applications. Specifically, this study exposed the pervasiveness and severity of the problem as well as illustrated the root causes, symptoms, and fixes. It generalized idempotency violation patterns from statically checkable instances in bug study and used these patterns to find more cases.
            - Collected 100+ Problematic Codebases from Open Source Github Repositories, categorized them by application type, API type, root cause, and symptoms, found general anti-patterns that lead to idempotency violations. 
            - Deployed 20+ repositories of serverless softwares, tested static checkers for anti-patterns and testing framework for symptom diagnosis.

        - title: Data Scheduling for Neural Networks on CPUs using SIMD Architecture
          contents:
          - We address the challenges associated with deploying neural networks on CPUs, with a particular focus on minimizing inference time while maintaining accuracy. Our novel approach is to use the dataflow (i.e., computation order) of a neural network to explore data reuse opportunitie using heuristic-guided analysis and a code generation framework, which enables exploration of various Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) implementations to achieve optimized neural network execution. Our results demonstrate that the dataflow that keeps outputs in SIMD registers while also maximizing both input and weight reuse consistently yields the best performance for a wide variety of inference workloads, achieving up to 2.7x speedup for 8-bit neural networks, and up to 4.8x speed up for binary neural networks, respectively, over the state-of-the-art SIMD implementations of neural networks today.
          - Proposed the research idea, extended discussion on neural network dataflows, developed a code generation framework, set up ARM server and, on top of it, the Gem5 simulator, ran experiments, analyzed results, composed the paper.
