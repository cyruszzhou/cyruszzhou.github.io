    - title: Compiler-level Optimization for Domain-specific Acceleration
      items: Current compiler optimization methods for general-purpose computing are usually unable to bring out the best performance on domain-specific workloads. I strive to find ways to make domain-specific tasks more efficient by manipulating low-level software respecting invariances in computations.
    - title: Hardware-software/algorithm Co-design for Emerging workloads
      items: Current hardware lacks effective support for many emerging workloads. My focus is to construct a true symbiotic loop between software/algorithm implementation, computer architecture, and the hardware basis.
    - title: Systems Reliability, Efficiency & Security
      items: More advanced workloads usually require support from large-scale systems, where reliability, efficiency, and security are three primary and equally important concerns. I aspire to provide tool support to make modern software systems reliable, efficient, and secure.
