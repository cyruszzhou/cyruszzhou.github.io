abstract = {Neural networks have become pervasive and are revolutionizing countless fields and applications. As such, there is a universal urge for more efficient ways to run deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent strides in quantization and mixed-precision techniques for neural networks are particularly promising. Notably, a research has shown that even ultra-low precision neural networks, wherein each parameter uses only 1 to 4 bits, are able to achieve state-of-the-art accuracies when we mix precision at a fine granularity (e.g., per channel, per parameter) and tailor the training schemes accordingly. Nevertheless, hardware support for running such neural networks remain largely lacking. Hardware architectures, training toolsets, and inference frameworks are yet to fully embrace the support required for these ultra-low precision models, especially when we perform precision-mixing at a fine granularity. Specifically, current architectures lack support for data-level precision heterogeneity, the training toolsets are unaware about the constraints imposed by the hardware for serving, and there is no inference framework for a better co-design solution. To address this, unlike traditional unidirectional approaches, our research introduces an innovative hardware-software co-design that forms a genuine feedback loop between hardware, training, and inference. In this paper, we present and evaluate three integrated solutions, each combining unique hardware adaptations, ISA extensions, training algorithms, and inference frameworks, using CPUs as a proof-of-concept.},

abstract = {We address the challenges associated with deploying neural networks on CPUs, with a particular focus on minimizing inference time while maintaining accuracy. Our novel approach is to use the dataflow (i.e., computation order) of a neural network to explore data reuse opportunitie using heuristic-guided analysis and a code generation framework, which enables exploration of various Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) implementations to achieve optimized neural network execution. Our results demonstrate that the dataflow that keeps outputs in SIMD registers while also maximizing both input and weight reuse consistently yields the best performance for a wide variety of inference workloads, achieving up to 2.7x speedup for 8-bit neural networks, and up to 4.8x speed up for binary neural networks, respectively, over the state-of-the-art SIMD implementations of neural networks today.},

title = {Understanding and Detecting Idempotency
Violations in Serverless Applications},
year = {2023},
publisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},
abstract = {Serverless applications are composed of event-
triggered serverless functions, which may be invoked multiple
times per incoming event, leading to duplicated notifications,
data inconsistency, and workflow interruptions. To prevent these
undesired effects, application developers must ensure the event
processing workflow is idempotent. However, this design require-
ment is often overlooked by developers, who are also in lack
of tools to pinpoint idempotency violations â€“ code regions that
violate the design intent if retried.
This paper first illustrates how serverless frameworks con-
tribute to idempotency violations, then examine the root cause,
symptoms, and remedies of 248 violations found in 128 Azure
and AWS serverless applications. Based on the findings, we built
static checkers to detect common violation patterns and a testing
framework to trigger and observe idempotency violations. Our
research aims to raise awareness of serverless idempotency vio-
lations and demonstrate that most of them can be systematically
detected and prevented},

abstract = {Trigger-action programming (TAP) empowers a wide array of users to automate Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, it can be challenging for users to create completely correct trigger-action programs (TAPs) on the first try, necessitating debugging. While TAP has received substantial research attention, TAP debugging has not. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of users' end-to-end TAP debugging process, focusing on obstacles users face in debugging TAPs and how well users ultimately fix incorrect automations. To enable this study, we added TAP capabilities to an existing 3-D smart home simulator. Thirty remote participants spent a total of 84 hours debugging TAPs using this simulator. Without additional support, participants were often unable to fix buggy TAPs due to a series of obstacles we document. However, we also found that two novel tools we developed helped participants overcome many of these obstacles and more successfully debug TAPs. These tools collect either implicit or explicit feedback from users about automations that should or should not have happened in the past, using a SAT-solving-based algorithm we developed to automatically modify the TAPs to account for this feedback.},
