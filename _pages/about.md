I am a rising senior at the `University of Chicago`, majoring in `Computer Science`. 

My research interest lies in `providing tool support for improving the security, reliability, and efficiency of large-scale and ubiquitous software systems`. I do weightlifting and drink (a lot of) coffee. I enjoy philosophy and literature.

At UChicago, I have been fortunate to be advised by [Professor Shan Lu](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~shanlu/), [Professor Yanjing Li](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~yanjingl/), and [Professor Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/). I had also been glad to work for [Professor Haryadi Gunawi](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~haryadi/) and [Professor Borja Sotomajor](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~borja/) as a Teaching Assistant on Computer Systems and Software Systems, respectively. I want to express my gratefulness to my PhD and undergraduate friends who have always supported me throughout my journey.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
