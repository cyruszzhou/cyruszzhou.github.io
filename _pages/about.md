I am a fourth-year student at the `University of Chicago`, majoring in `Computer Science`. 

My current research interest lies in `hardware-software co-design and compiler-level optimization for emerging workloads`, especially for `deep learning` tasks. I do weightlifting and drink (a lot of) coffee. I enjoy philosophy and literature.

I grew up in [Ningbo, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningbo), where I spent my childhood and completed my schooling, encompassing elementary through [high school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaoshi_Middle_School).

At UChicago, I have been fortunate to be advised by [Professor Shan Lu](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~shanlu/), [Professor Yanjing Li](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~yanjingl/), and [Professor Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/). 


<!-- I had also been glad to work for [Professor Junchen Jiang](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~junchenj/), [Professor Yanjing Li](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~yanjingl/), [Professor Ben Zhao](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/), [Professor Haryadi Gunawi](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~haryadi/) and [Professor Borja Sotomajor](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~borja/) as a Teaching Assistant on Computer Systems and Software Systems, respectively. -->

<!-- Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
